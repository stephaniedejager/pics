# Pics React App

Covered:
Handling Input

3 Components

    -App
    -SearchBar  
    -ImageList

SearchBar implemented using a Class based component, because it needs to use state system to handle user input.

Covered event handlers and implemented onClick (for the input typed in) and onSubmit to disable the default functionality of the form element.

Also covered the this pointer and how to handle it when we want to refer to an object in a function.

Stored the API access key and secret in a config file that I included in .gitignore to keep it safe and hide it from public.
